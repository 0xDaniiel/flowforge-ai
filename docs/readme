# **What the Project Is All About (README Explanation)**

**FlowForge AI** is a **visual AI agent builder** that lets users design, connect, and simulate how an AI agent works — using an interactive, drag-and-drop interface.

Instead of writing code, users can create agents by connecting **nodes** that represent steps such as:

- fetching data
- transforming information
- making decisions
- calling an AI model
- triggering actions

Each node represents a specific operation in the agent’s workflow. Users can connect these nodes to define the logic, then **run a simulation** to see how data moves through the system in real time.

The project is built with **Next.js**, **React Flow**, **Zustand**, and **TailwindCSS**, and focuses on showing how AI workflows can be represented visually — similar to tools like LangFlow, Flowise, n8n, or Zapier.

### **What This Project Demonstrates**

This project shows your ability to build:

- **Complex UI logic**
- **State management**
- **Graph-based interfaces**
- **Drag-and-drop editors**
- **Interactive workflow tools**
- **Modern AI product UI/UX**
- **React Flow node systems**
- **Execution simulation and animations**

### **Why It Matters**

AI workflow tools are becoming a major trend in Europe, especially Germany and Switzerland.
Companies need frontend engineers who understand:

- **visualization of processes**
- **state machines**
- **node-based editors**
- **AI agent orchestration**

This project demonstrates exactly that.
